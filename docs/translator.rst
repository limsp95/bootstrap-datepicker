Translator
=======

You’re in charge of submitting clips that you deem to be interesting. Just keep an eye out when you’re watching streams/archives. 


Your task
-----

Once you have found clips that you think should be translated, go into the Aonahara spreadsheet and fill out the information about your clip(?)


.. code-block:: html

    <input type="fsdfsdf" class="form-control" value="fgfvb">

.. figure:: _static/screenshots/aaa.png
    :align: center

After you have made the addition to the spreadsheet, go into mikuri’s discord server and make a post in #find-translators-request with the following format:

* REQUESTING TRANSLATION
[entry ID in the aonahara sheet]
[description of clips]
Link1, timestamps
Link2, timestamps
Link3, timestamps
…
(optional ping to all translators, do this at your own risk)
Ex. 

* REQUESTING TRANSLATION
ID - 1
Description: aqua gets cucked by okayu and throws a fit
youtube.com/whatever, [1:00-3:00, 45:23-56:45]
youtube.com/whatever2, [1:23:23-1:43:45] 

Now you are done! You can just sit back and wait for a translator to come pick it up, or go look for more clips!
