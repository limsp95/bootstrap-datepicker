Translator
=======

You’re in charge of taking a clip and turning it into a script. When you find a clip to your liking, check the “taken” checkbox for that ID in the aonahara spreadsheet “requires translator” and put your name down. 


Your task
-----

Find the corresponding translation request post in mikuri’s server in the #find-translators-request channel, and react to it with a :thumbsup


Take the clips and translate them line by line with the corresponding timestamps (official format in the words right now. Just go with what works for now). 


* Note
.. code-block::

    You’re allowed to go outside the timestamps specified by the clipper if you think it improves something.


Put your work into the folder you created and name it “Translation”

Make another document in the folder called “meta”, and propose a title and description for this video in that document.

Once you have a working first draft, fill in a proofreader request in the aonahara spreadsheet. Then, go into mikuri’s discord server and make a post in #translation-progress with the following format:

* REQUESTING PROOFREADER
.. code-block::  
    
    [entry ID in the spreadsheet]
    [description of clips]
    (Optional ping to all proofreaders, do this at your own risk) 
 
 Ex.
 .. code-block::  
    
    REQUESTING PROOFREADER
    ID-1
    Description: aqua gets cucked by okayu and throws a fit

Wait for a proofreader to pick this up and work with them until you have something that you both deem satisfying.

At this point, unless a quality assurance member comes to you, you are done! Sit back and relax or go look for more clips to translate!
