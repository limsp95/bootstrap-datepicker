Proofreader
=======

You’re in charge of making sure the English in the translated script is good. When you find a translation script to your liking, check the “taken” checkbox for that ID in the “requires proofreader“ and fill in your name.


Your task
-----

Go find the corresponding proofreader request post in mikuri’s server in the ``#translation-progress`` channel and react to it with a :thumbsup


To find the script, go into the folder with the corresponding ID.


* Tips
.. code-block::

    (helpful comment: If the translator used google docs to translate, try making suggestions in suggest mode)



Go through as many iterations as you need to reach a consensus.

Make another document in the folder called “meta”, and propose a title and description for this video in that document.

Once a consensus is reached, fill in a subber request. In addition, go into mikuri’s server and make a post in ``#translation-progress`` with the following format:

* REQUESTING SUBBER
.. code-block::  
    
    [entry ID in the spreadsheet]
    [basic description of the content]
    (optional ping to all subbers, do this at your own risk)
 
Ex.
 .. code-block::  
    
    REQUESTING SUBBER
    ID-1
    Description: Aqua gets cucked by Marine


Unless a quality assurance member comes to you, you’re done! You can kick back and relax or go look for more scripts to proofread!
