Subber
=======

You’re in charge of downloading and clipping the video. As well as subbing the clipped video and producing a .ass file for the editor. This means SOFT subs.


Your task
-----

You can go to the Aonahara spreadsheet “requires subbing” tab to find a video that has been clipped and translated. Once you’ve taken it, check the checkbox in the “taken” column and fill in your name.


Go into ``#translation-progress`` in mikuri’s server and find the corresponding subber request post. React to it with a :thumbsup


Start downloading, clipping, and subbing.


Once you’ve finished that, put it into the folder with the corresponding ID and name your video “subbed”


Go into the Aonahara spreadsheet and make an editor request. In addition, go into mikuri’s server and make a post in the #help-with-videos channel in the following format:

* REQUESTING EDITOR
.. code-block::  
    
    [entry ID in the spreadsheet]
    [basic description of content]
    (optional ping to all editors, do this at your own risk)

 
Ex.
 .. code-block::  
    
    REQUESTING EDITOR
    ID-1
    Aqua gets cucked by Marine


Unless a quality assurance member comes to you, you’re done! Kick back and chillax or go look for more stuff to sub
